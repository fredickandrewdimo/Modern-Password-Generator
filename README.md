# Modern-Password-Generator

The password generator is a web-based tool that utilizes **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. The design of the generator is based on frontend mentor challenges.

The **zxcvbn** JS library is integrated to accurately evaluate the strength of the generated password.

Users have the flexibility to customize the length and character set of the password through the use of range input and checkbox input features. The generated password can then be easily copied to the clipboard for secure storage.
